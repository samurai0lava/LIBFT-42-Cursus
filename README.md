# LIBFT Project

Welcome to the LIBFT project! This project is part of the 42 curriculum and aims to create your own C library. The library, named "libft," will contain re-implementations of various standard C library functions, as well as additional functions that might be useful in future projects.

## Introduction

The LIBFT project is designed to strengthen your understanding of C programming and the standard library functions. It requires you to implement fundamental functions, such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list operations. Additionally, you'll create new functions that could be beneficial in future 42 projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LIBFT project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd libft`
3. Compile the library: `make`
4. You should now have a `libft.a` library file in the project directory.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `libft.h`: Header file containing function prototypes.
- `Makefile`: Makefile to compile the library.


## Usage

To use the LIBFT library in your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `libft.a` library file to your project directory.
2. Include the `libft.h` header file in your source code.
3. Compile your project with the LIBFT library: `gcc -o your_project your_project.c libft.a`

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on each function, refer to the comments in the `libft.h` header file. Additionally, you can find information on standard C library functions to understand their behavior and usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or create a pull request. Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and provide clear documentation for new functions.
